In LangChain for LLM Application Development, you will gain essential skills in expanding the use cases and capabilities of language models in application development using the LangChain framework.

Learn LangChain directly from the creator of the framework, Harrison Chase

Apply LLMs to your proprietary data to build personal assistants and specialized chatbots

Use agents, chained calls, and memories to expand your use of LLMs

In this course you will learn and get experience with the following topics:

Models, Prompts and Parsers: calling LLMs, providing prompts and parsing the response
Memories for LLMs: memories to store conversations and manage limited context space
Chains: creating sequences of operations
Question Answering over Documents: apply LLMs to your proprietary data and use case requirements
Agents: explore the powerful emerging development of LLM as reasoning agents.
This one-hour course, instructed by the creator of LangChain Harrison Chase as well as Andrew Ng will vastly expand the possibilities for leveraging powerful language models, where you can now create incredibly robust applications in a matter of hours.
