# portfolio-repo
My portfolio including coursework, assessments, and coding tests from all of my certifications and courses I've taken; as well as projects i am working on or have completed.

I have completed my Tensorflow and Mastering Gen AI w/ OpenAI certifications and Coursework but am working to get them all in a folder and all the coursework in there so it will hopefully be added in the next week or 2 when i find time

I am currently working on my Improving Deep Neural Nets, Machine Learning in Production, and RAG courses and those will be added once I am completed them


Outside of coursework and projects for the certifications, I have done a Teacher-Student Knowledge Distillation Image Classification architecture/model but am working on the distillation part, a genetic CNN, and am working on creating a SEO ai agent
