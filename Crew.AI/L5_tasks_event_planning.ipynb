      "Ah, San Francisco. Founded about a week before America declared independence, it wouldn’t become part of the country until 1850, along with the rest of California. But when it did, it quickly became a jewel in America’s crown. This city has been a symbol of Pacific Coast excellence and hospitality for a long, long time. Keeping that tradition alive is what we’re all about at San Francisco Catering Company. Count on us for simplicity and superb service that will make you and the people you want to feed happy.\n",
      "GET RESTAURANT QUALITY DINING WHERE YOU NEED IT.\n",
      "In San Francisco, catering needs to be great to hold its own against all the incredible restaurant food in this town. That’s why we have first-class chefs and a staff dedicated to treating you like the most important client in town. In fact, working with us is even easier than ordering at a restaurant. Our system is designed to make planning an amazing meal for hundreds of people no more complicated than ordering a tray of delicious sandwiches for drop-off at your home or office. We’ve got everything laid out clearly with all of our pricing right there up front, so you can plan with your budget in mind.\n",
      "WE’RE YOUR ONE-STOP SHOP FOR EVERYTHING.\n",
      "For larger affairs, we can also provide all the rentals, bartenders and service staff you need. We don’t do onsite chefs, tents or alcohol but we have carefully selected partner companies we work with to get all of those for you—partners who understand how to deliver San Francisco catering quality.\n",
      "LET’S TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED.\n",
      "Whether you’re looking for a caterer for a single large affair, a go-to team you can always count on to bring top quality food to your office, or something in between, we want to hear about your needs. Let’s set up some time to talk. We’ll meet you anytime, anywhere. San Francisco is our town, too, so we’re always up for a chance to get out and enjoy it. Tell us where and when and we’ll be there.\n",
